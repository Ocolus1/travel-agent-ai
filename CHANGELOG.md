# Changelog

All notable changes to the AI Travel Agent project will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-10-06

### Fixed

#### üìÅ **Unique File Naming for Multiple Itineraries**
- **Issue**: Files in exports folder had generic names that got overwritten with each new query
  - Only `Lagos_Nigeria_itinerary.ics` included destination info
  - `travel_itinerary.md` and `calendar_events.txt` were generic and conflicted
  - No way to differentiate files from different queries
- **Fix**: Implemented dynamic file renaming with destination and start date
- **Changes**:
  - Added `rename_export_files()` function to rename files after crew generation
  - Files now named with pattern: `[YYYYMMDD]_[destination]_[type].[ext]`
  - Example: `20251105_Lagos_Nigeria_itinerary.md`
  - Added `get_export_filenames()` helper to get expected filenames
  - Updated `create_download_zip()` to use new filename pattern
  - ZIP filename now includes date: `20251105_Lagos_Nigeria_trip_files.zip`

**New File Naming Convention:**
- **Itinerary**: `[YYYYMMDD]_[destination]_itinerary.md`
- **Calendar Events**: `[YYYYMMDD]_[destination]_calendar_events.txt`
- **ICS File**: `[destination]_itinerary.ics` (already had destination)

**Benefits:**
- Each query generates uniquely named files
- No file overwrites when creating multiple itineraries
- Easy to identify which files belong to which trip
- Date prefix allows chronological sorting

#### üì• **Fixed Full Itinerary Tab Download Button**
- **Issue**: Download button in "Full Itinerary" tab downloaded entire ZIP file instead of just the itinerary
- **User Intent**: Download button should provide only the itinerary text file, not all trip files
- **Fix**: Changed download to provide only the Markdown itinerary file
- **Changes**:
  - Updated Full Itinerary tab download to use `get_export_filenames()` 
  - Downloads single `.md` file instead of ZIP
  - Button label changed to "üì• Download Itinerary (Text)"
  - MIME type changed to `text/markdown`

**Benefits:**
- Clear separation: Full Itinerary tab = just itinerary file
- Export Files tab = all files in ZIP
- Users can quickly download just the text they're viewing

#### üìù **Improved Download Button Descriptions**
- **Issue**: Unclear what was included in ZIP downloads
- **Fix**: Enhanced all download button labels and help text
- **Changes**:
  - Sidebar button: "üì• Download All Trip Files (ZIP)" with detailed help text
  - Full Itinerary tab: "üì• Download Itinerary (Text)" - single file download
  - Export tab: "üì• Download All Trip Files (ZIP)" with detailed description
  - Added help tooltips explaining exact contents of each download
  - Updated Export tab description to mention unique file naming

**New Descriptions Include:**
- Exact file types (Markdown, TXT, ICS)
- Purpose of each file
- Note about unique naming with destination and dates

**Files Modified:**
- `app.py` - Added `rename_export_files()`, `get_export_filenames()`, updated download buttons, improved descriptions

**Result:** Users can now generate multiple itineraries without file conflicts, and download buttons clearly indicate what's being downloaded!
